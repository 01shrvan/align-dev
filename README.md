# Align Network

> **Aligning minds, just for you.** A social network where creators find their people based on how they think, not follower counts.

---

## What is Align?

Align is a creator platform built on a simple idea: **social networks shouldn't reward virality—they should reward thinking.**

On Twitter, you get algorithmic amplification for rage. On Instagram, it's aesthetics. On LinkedIn, it's job titles. None of them help you actually find your people.

Align does. We connect creators with audiences that genuinely care about their work—through shared interests, verification, and transparent algorithms.

### The Problem We're Solving

Every major social platform is fundamentally broken for creators who care about depth:

- **Engagement gaming:** Posts that trigger emotion outrank posts that create value
- **Follower-based visibility:** Being new means invisibility, regardless of quality
- **Algorithm opacity:** You post, something happens, you don't know why
- **Network lock-in:** You're trapped following people you originally followed for one reason

Result: Creators either compromise their work or quit.

### Our Solution

An algorithm designed from the ground up for **thinking alignment**:

1. **Match by interests, not virality** — Posts surface based on how well they align with what you actually care about
2. **Verify quality creators** — Verified creators float to the top, but the algorithm still discovers new talent
3. **Weight engagement by type** — Comments matter more than likes (they indicate real engagement)
4. **Show your reasoning** — Every post explains why it appeared in your feed
5. **Kill the cold start problem** — New creators with good ideas still get seen

## How It Works

### The Algorithm (Simplified)

Every post gets scored on:

```
Score =
  0.40 × (You follow this creator) +
  0.25 × (Post matches your interests) +
  0.20 × (Quality engagement: comments/bookmarks vs. likes) +
  0.15 × (Creator's audience size—mild boost) +
  0.10 × (Post is recent) +
  0.10 × (Creator thinks like you)
```

**Why this works:**

- Followers matter (0.40) because you consciously chose to follow for a reason
- Interest matching (0.25) enables discovery beyond your network
- Engagement quality (0.20) means thoughtful posts beat popular posts
- Social proof (0.15) surfaces established creators without letting them takeover
- Recency (0.10) keeps feeds fresh without burying old quality content
- Similar thinking (0.10) adds serendipity—discover people exploring adjacent ideas

### What You See

Every post in your feed shows:

- **Why it appeared:** "Matches: TypeScript, System Design" or "From @designer.jane"
- **How much weight each signal had:** Transparency builds trust
- **Comments prioritized over likes:** The algorithm rewards depth

## Key Ideas

### 1. Interest-Based Matching (Not Following-Only)

Your feed isn't limited to who you follow. Instead:

- You tell us your interests: "TypeScript", "Design Systems", "Cloud Architecture"
- Posts get automatically tagged with topics
- We use Jaccard similarity to match you with relevant posts, even from creators you don't follow yet

This solves the discovery problem—new creators with good ideas don't get buried.

### 2. Verification Prioritizes Without Gatekeeping

Verified creators (curated by us) float to the top, but:

- Non-verified creators still rank by the full algorithm
- New creators can still break through with good content
- Verification is earned, not purchased

This prevents the "Twitter effect" where only celebs get visibility.

### 3. Engagement Quality Over Volume

We differentiate between engagement types:

- **Likes:** Passive, weighted lowest
- **Comments:** Active engagement, weighted higher
- **Bookmarks:** "I want to reference this later", weighted highest

A post with 10 comments beats a post with 100 likes because comments indicate real thought.

### 4. Transparent Reasoning

When you see a post, you see:

- Why the algorithm showed it to you
- How much each factor influenced the decision
- The actual scoring breakdown

This builds trust. You're not confused by algorithmic magic—you understand why you're seeing what you're seeing.

### 5. Creator-Friendly Discovery

For creators:

- Your posts surface based on how well they match audience interests
- No need to game engagement metrics
- Quality thinking gets rewarded over sensationalism
- New creators can break through without viral mechanics

## The Thinking Behind Decisions

### Why 0.40 weight for followers?

Followers are intentional signals. Users consciously chose to follow this creator. But 0.40 (not 0.6+) ensures discovery beyond your current network—you want both the people you follow AND people exploring your interests.

### Why Jaccard similarity for interests?

Set-based similarity handles categorical data well. When we say "matches 3 of 5 interests," users immediately understand why. No black-box embeddings—just honest math.

### Why verified creators get priority but not absolute dominance?

Verification should prioritize quality without gatekeeping. Verified posts float to top, but we still rank them by recency within that tier. Non-verified creators still rank by full algorithm. This balance encourages quality without crushing new talent.

### Why limit to 3 posts per author?

Feed diversity is proven to reduce filter bubbles and improve engagement. Three posts lets prolific creators maintain visibility without feed takeover.

### Why weight comments 3x likes?

Comments require thought. Someone who comments engaged with your idea, disagreed, added insight, or discussed. Likes are passive thumb reactions. Comments are effort.
